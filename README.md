# odin-rock-paper-scissors

This is going to be a console-version of rock-paper-scissors (my first JS-project ðŸ¥³ ) as part of the Odin Project. GUI will be added in assignments later on during the course.

Basic Rule:
    Rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

In this Version, I'm playing against the computer.
